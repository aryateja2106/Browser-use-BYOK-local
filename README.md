# Browser-Use: Empowering AI Agents with Web and macOS Control

Hello there! I'm Arya Teja Rudraraju, an AI Product Manager passionate about making cutting-edge technology accessible to everyone. This repository is my endeavor to inspire and guide you through building powerful AI agents that can interact with both web browsers and your macOS system.

Inspired by the innovative work of the `browser-use` and `macOS-use` projects, I've consolidated and streamlined the setup process to provide a clear, step-by-step guide for beginners. My goal is to empower you to easily set up and experiment with these exciting technologies locally.

## Getting Started: A Beginner's Guide

This project is divided into two main components:

1.  **Web UI (`web-ui/`):** A web-based interface for controlling a browser automation agent.
2.  **macOS Use (`macOS-use/`):** Enables AI agents to interact with and control your macOS system.

To get started, simply navigate to the respective directory and follow the detailed `README.md` instructions within each. Each `README.md` is designed to be a comprehensive guide, assuming minimal prior experience.

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aryateja2106/browser-use-web-UI.git
    cd browser-use-web-UI
    ```

2.  **Choose your adventure:**

    *   For **Web UI** setup and usage, navigate to `web-ui/`:

        ```bash
        cd web-ui
        ```
        Then, follow the instructions in `web-ui/README.md`.

    *   For **macOS Use** setup and usage, navigate to `macOS-use/`:

        ```bash
        cd macOS-use
        ```
        Then, follow the instructions in `macOS-use/README.md`.


I hope this project serves as a valuable resource on your journey to explore the exciting world of AI agents and their capabilities. Happy experimenting!
